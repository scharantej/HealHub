## Flask Application Design for a Mental Health Awareness Campaign Landing Page

### HTML Files

- **index.html**: This is the main HTML file that will serve as the landing page for the mental health awareness campaign. It will include the necessary images, text, and HTML elements to convey the campaign's message and provide information to visitors.
- **resources.html**: This HTML file will provide a list of resources for mental health support and crisis assistance. It will include contact information for mental health hotlines, support groups, and online resources.

### Routes

- **route ('/')**: This route will handle requests for the landing page. It will render the 'index.html' file to display the campaign's message and content.
- **route('/resources')**: This route will handle requests for the resources page. It will render the 'resources.html' file to provide visitors with a list of mental health support and crisis assistance resources.
